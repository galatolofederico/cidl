# Lecture 4: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Overview 🌐

In this session, we covered the basics of Recurrent Neural Network, space-time unfolding and Backpropagation through time (BPTT). Additionally, we explore the evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), delving into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures.
